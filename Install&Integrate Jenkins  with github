- Replace java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel with the appropriate package name for your Linux distribution.

Jenkins Installation: Install Jenkins using the following steps:


sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum install jenkins
Start Jenkins: Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start on boot:

- sudo systemctl start jenkins
- sudo systemctl enable jenkins
